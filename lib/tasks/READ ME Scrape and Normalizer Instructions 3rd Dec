Scrape and Normalizer Instructions 3rd Dec

1. Run the scrape_ingest_ccssf.rake to grab data from the children's council. This should map to the daycareproviders model/table. The daycarelicenses and daycareschedulehours are also part of this scrape. Really they should be the tables where raw data is entered. There is a uniqueness check in their models, such that when data comes in we don't save any duplicated. 

2. Basically do the same for dss_ca_gov_day_care_raws. The scrape_dss_ca_gove.rake hits the angular api, but should be modified to take the csv upload. 

3. Run the normalize_scraped_data_to_realdaycareproviders.rake, which will take both sources of data an create realdaycareprovider objects. Having this unifing object allows for you to add value added data to it, without dealing with different datamodels (dss and ccssf) and it also future proofs the capability making it marginally easier to handle new sources of data.

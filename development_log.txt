- creaetd a rake task to ingest raw csvs. This instance is for trulia, but can be extended. 
- use rake tasks to kick off scraping from now on. The scraping scripts will populate intermediary ingestion tables and a future process will map it to an actual properties table after a match has been attempted with the official addresses table 

- next steps 
- get a postgres ui working to validate data
- hook up trulia scraper to rake and start getting new data for the trulia ingest table
- create core property model and child listing and recent_sales models.
